Hello. This repository contains the underlying code for the NCD3 dashboard found here: https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/figures.html. The NCD3 dashboard serves as the official communicable disease case counts from the NC Division of Public Health. The SAS file is the official version. The R file is there as a benefit to those who program in R, but may not be fully up to date.
